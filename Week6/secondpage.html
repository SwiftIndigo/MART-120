    <h1>About my artowrk.</h1>

<p>As some may know by now, one of my favorite hobbies is music production! It brings me great joy to create music and explore different elements of sound design. I started using FL Studio a few years ago and am happy with the progress I have made. Music has also drawn amazing friends into my life and creating art with them feels like a real privelege! Below is the artowrk I made for my first official album that I created using Adobe Photoshop!
